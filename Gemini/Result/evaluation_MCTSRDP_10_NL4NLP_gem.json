The objective is to maximize profit `0.5*x + y`, where `x` is the investment in condos and `y` is in detached houses. The solution correctly adheres to all constraints: the total budget (`x + y <= 760000`), the minimum condo investment (`x >= 0.2*(x+y)`), and the minimum detached house investment (`y >= 20000`). The reported optimal solution `x=152000`, `y=608000` yields the maximum profit of $684000, which matches the ground truth. The constraints are satisfied: total investment is exactly $760000, condo investment is exactly 20% of the total ($152000 = 0.2 * 760000$), and house investment is well above the minimum ($608000 > 20000$).

This solution satisfies all constraints: tooth medication used is 10*30 + 15*30 = 750 <= 2000, the number of small bones is 50% of the total (30 >= 0.5 * (30+30)), and the number of large bones is at least 30 (30 >= 30).
